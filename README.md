This project was created out of my frustration with dependency management in librarian-puppet.

some people need external dependencies. I just need to be able to pin revisions for a collection of modules.

I found the dependency managment features of librarian puppet too heavy for my simple use case.

this project just has one commend

  librarian-puppet install [--verbose]

it iterates through your Puppetfile and installs git sources.
